# FlappySpinner
FlappySpinner game based on libGDX framework.
So, that project extends by popular game named Flappy Bird.
Actually this is clone of Flappy Bird, but bird looks like fidget spinner and tubes like vapers and giroskuters (not MVP).
No help need. You can just follow project or create branches for your versions of game.
As you can see, its open source project and in not far future it will be learning example of libGDX.
